## Notes
- If you have **SVG masters**, add them under `assets/logo/svg/` and `assets/badge/svg/` for perfect scaling and to generate Safari pinned-tab SVGs.
- The manifest theme/background color was derived from the dominant color of your icon/logo: **#ffffff**.
- Replace `/assets/...` URLs if you serve from a different path.

## Next Steps
1. Drop the `assets/` folder into your site’s public/static directory (e.g., Cloudflare Pages).
2. Reference `/assets/app/manifest.webmanifest` in your HTML head.
3. Add HTML favicons:
   ```html
   <link rel="icon" href="/assets/app/favicon.ico">
   <link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="/assets/app/apple-touch-icon.png">
   <link rel="manifest" href="/assets/app/manifest.webmanifest">
   ```
4. For social sharing, create OG images later (1200×630 / 1200×1200).


## Vector Masters
- `assets/app/safari-pinned-tab.svg` (check that paths are solid fills for Safari pinned tabs; consider a monochrome simplification if needed)
- `assets/badge/svg/lucidseal-badge-set.svg`
- `assets/brand/LucidSeal_Badge_Guidelines_v1.pdf`
